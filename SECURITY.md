# Security Policy

## Supported versions

Security fixes target the current `main` branch until versioned releases are
published.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Do not open a public issue for a vulnerability. Use private vulnerability
reporting on the repository host when available, or contact the maintainer
privately through the channel that provided repository access.

Include:

- affected commit or version
- reproduction steps
- expected impact
- whether desktop/browser content, screenshots, page text, URLs, tab/history
  data, credentials, tokens, cookies, headers, or local files can be exposed

## Security expectations

This project must not commit credentials, tokens, private keys, screenshots,
`.env` files, or app-server logs. Runtime diagnostics must pass through the
recursive redaction layer.

Desktop automation must fail closed when required native permissions or Codex
dependencies are unavailable. Interactive write tools require confirmation;
headless calls remain subject to OMO's permission preset and explicit rules.

Chrome must keep browser handles and `node_repl` private, reject untrusted
app-server versions and broken plugin contracts, decline elicitation, isolate
one owned tab per settled run, and never replay or fall back after a possible
dispatch.
